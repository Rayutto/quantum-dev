# quantum-dev

**quantum-dev** is a collaborative environment for developing quantum simulations and visualizations using [QuTiP](http://qutip.org/) inside containers (e.g., via VS Code Dev Containers or Docker).  
It also includes a collection of exercises, examples, and experiments based on the textbook *Introduction à la théorie quantique* (see Acknowledgments).

## 📖 Acknowledgments

We thank the authors of the book *Introduction à la théorie quantique* (Éditions Ellipses):

- Michèle Desouter  
- Yves Justum  
- Xavier Chapuisat  

We also acknowledge Michel Menou for his contributions to the exercises.  
Some exercises are reproduced and solved here.  
We **highly recommend** this book to French-speaking readers who want a rigorous and accessible introduction to quantum physics.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Remote - Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### 📦 Using the Dev Container (Recommended)

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/quantum-dev.git
   cd quantum-dev

2.	Open it in VS Code and click:
> Reopen in Container
(or use Command Palette: Ctrl+Shift+P → Dev Containers: Reopen in Container)

This will:
	•	Build the container from Dockerfile
	•	Install Python, QuTiP, Jupyter, and other dependencies
	•	Mount your local code inside the container

You’re ready to code and run simulations!
